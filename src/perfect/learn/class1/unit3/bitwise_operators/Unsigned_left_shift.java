/*
    The Unsigned Right Shift
    As you have just seen, the >> operator automatically fills the high-order bit with its previous
    contents each time a shift occurs. This preserves the sign of the value. However, sometimes
    this is undesirable. For example, if you are shifting something that does not represent a
    numeric value, you may not want sign extension to take place. This situation is common
    when you are working with pixel-based values and graphics. In these cases, you will
    generally want to shift a zero into the high-order bit no matter what its initial value was.
    This is known as an unsigned shift. To accomplish this, you will use Javaâ€™s unsigned,
     shiftright operator, >>>, which always shifts zeros into the high-order bit.
