   /*
   Java defines eight primitive types of data:
    1.  byte        1 byte
    2.  short       2 byte
    3.  int         4 byte
    4.  long        8 byte

    5.  char        2 byte   UNICODE-> 2 byte 2^16
    6.  float       4 byte
    7.  double      8 byte
    8.  boolean     1 bit

    //we can group them as bellow...

    1. Integer :                byte, short, int, long
    2. Floating point number:   float, double
    3. Character:               char
    4. Boolean:                 boolean


    Although Java is  completely object-oriented, the primitive types are not.
    Java does not support unsigned


    //Floating point Types
    Name            Width in Bits           Approximate Range
    double          64                      4.9e–324 to 1.8e+308
    float           32                      1.4e–045 to 3.4e+038
    //double
     sin( ), cos( ) and sqrt( ) return double values
     The true literal in Java does not equal 1, nor does the false literal equal 0.

     //String
    As you may know, in some other languages, including C/C++, strings are implemented as arrays of
    characters. However, this is not the case in Java. Strings are actually object types.
