    //Variables
    A variable is a container that stores a value.
    This value can be changed during the execution of the program.

    //Rules for declaring a variable name

    We can choose a name while declaring a Java variable if the following rules are followed:

    Must not begin with a digit. (E.g., 1tata is an invalid variable)
    Name is caseSensitive. (Tata and tata are different)
    Should not be a keyword (like Void).
    White space is not allowed. (int flying pen    is invalid)
    Can contain alphabets, $character, _character, and digits if the other conditions are met.
